TELL ME IF IT COMPLAINS ABOUT MISSING DLLs OR STUFF
or if you want the code
(not publishing atm because it looks lore like a mess .-.)


How to use:

1. open
2. Insert filename (no spaces, only from a-z, A-Z and 0-1...)
3. insert captures per second (like 1 or 5 or even 10 if you want it very fast)
4. insert framerate (30 is the best choice)

to end it:
1. click to focus the preview window
2. press ESC
3. wait till it wrote out the buffer

so easy *^*

captures screen in 1:1 size

don't be confused by the sizes in the command window, they are the RAM sizes
the vid will be about 10% the size
