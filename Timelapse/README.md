TELL ME IF IT COMPLAINS ABOUT MISSING DLLs OR STUFF
or if you want the code
(not publishing atm because it looks lore like a mess .-.)

DO NOT LOOK IN THE SOURCE CODE

I warned you...
it is mostly uncommented and not well written...

I plan to update the video output to write in h264 mp4/mkv files... so they don't grow into eternal size...
(I already put an eye on ffmpeg n stuff... gonna do it soon because friends requested this little gadet to record timelases without gigabytes of stream video and then throw away most of the images when increasing the video speed...)



How to use:

1. open
2. Insert filename (no spaces, only from a-z, A-Z and 0-1...)
3. insert captures per second (like 1 or 5 or even 10 if you want it very fast)
4. insert framerate (30 is the best choice)

to end it:
1. click to focus the preview window
2. press ESC
3. wait till it wrote out the buffer

so easy *^*

captures screen in 1:1 size

don't be confused by the sizes in the command window, they are the RAM sizes
the vid will be about 10% the size
